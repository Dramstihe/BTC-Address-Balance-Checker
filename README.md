<h1 style="text-align: center;">ðŸ’°Bitcoin Address Balance CheckerðŸ’°</h1>
<p>A simple Python script that checks the balance of a list of Bitcoin addresses. The script uses the <a href="https://blockchain.info/">Blockchain.info</a> API to retrieve the balance of each address and writes the addresses with a positive balance to an output file named 'hits.txt' . The addresses can be read from a text file 'addresses.txt' and the script will output the address and balance for each address in the file in the format of "Address: [Bitcoin Address] - Balance: [Balance]".</p>
<p>ðŸ”¥This script is perfect for anyone looking to check the balance of multiple Bitcoin addresses at once, or for anyone who wants to check their own Bitcoin wallet balance without having to log into a website.ðŸ”¥</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">ðŸš€Getting startedðŸš€</h2>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository</li>
<li>Place your list of Bitcoin addresses in a text file named "addresses.txt" (Make sure each address is on a new line within the text file).</li>
<li>Run the script using python3</li>
</ol>
<p>The script uses the <code>requests</code> library to make a GET request to the Blockchain.info API and retrieve the balance of each address. It then parses the JSON response and retrieves the final_balance field for each address. If the address is not found or an error occurs, the script will print an error message and continue to the next address.</p>
<p>You can customize the script to suit your needs by changing the threshold for a "positive" balance or by adding additional error handling. </p>
